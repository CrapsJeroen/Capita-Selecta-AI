Texts from books and other sources often contain a large amount of information. Natural languages are flexible enough to communicate complex concepts, intricate relations and more. However, AI systems currently have a hard time accessing and reasoning with the knowledge contained in texts.
\\
Even though interpreting natural is, so far, an unsolved problem, the limited scope of solving science tests brings a solution within reach. A significant part of the knowledge can be expressed with relations like ``X causes Y'', ``X is part of Y'', ``X is an example of Y'' or ``X [verb] Y''. The algorithm by Clark et al. \cite{construction} uses a hand-crafted set of extraction rules to generate so-called extractions from the text. Figure \ref{fig:extraction} shows an example of this. Extractions are a semi-formal data structure, but they can easily be translated into formal representation. Many of these rules combined form a knowledge base.
