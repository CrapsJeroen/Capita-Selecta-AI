# Capita Selecta for A.I. 2016-2017

This repo contains the work of Craps Jeroen and De Waen Jorik for the course on selected topics in artificial intelligence at the KU Leuven during the academic year of 2016-2017

## Contemporary topic in AI

Given a topic the students were required to do the necessary research to be able to summarise the topic and present their understanding and knowledge about it. 

## Community Detection

The goal of this part was to find a gap in the literature of algorithms for community detection in very large graphs. 
The approach we took in this assigment was that we would create cliques of nodes to reduce the general size of the graph. The main conclusion was that we could improve the baseline for genetic algorithms by a significant margin.
