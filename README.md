This repo contains the work of Craps Jeroen and De Waen Jorik for the course on selected topics in artificial intelligence at the KU Leuven during the academic year of 2016-2017

## Contemporary topic in AI

## Community Detection

The goal of this part was to find a gap in the literature of algorithms for community detection in very large graphs.
